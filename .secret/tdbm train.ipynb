    "# Efficient TMDB API Calls\n",
    "You have already written a function to combine the certification with the rest of the .info() from the TMDB API results. This lesson will help prepare you for the project. You may want to check out the specifications of project - part 2 for an overview of the task prior to working through this lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before jumping into the code, it is important to outline in plain language what you are trying to do. Before you can ask the computer to do it, you have to really understand what you are asking. This week has introduced some new code that you may still be getting used to, so this lesson will help walk you through the task. We will go through the individual pieces of code, but for the project, you will need to put it all together, in a logical order, with correct formatting! There will be an OUTER and INNER loop: a loop within a loop!\n",

    "### Our goal will be to\n",
    "\n",

    "Develop code to make API calls based on our existing IMDB IDs with the INNER Loop\n",
    "Organize output by year into separate .json files using an OUTER LOOP\n",

    "\n",
    "### BEFORE the Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Designate a folder to save your information\n",
    "Define the years you wish to retrieve\n",

    "### Create an OUTER loop for each year with a progress bar using tqdm_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a JSON_FILE filename to save the results in progress.\n",
    "Check if the file exists.\n",
    "if no:\n",
    "Create the empty JSON file with with open that just contains the key \"imdb_id\"\n",
    "if yes:\n",
    "Do nothing.\n",
    "Define/filter the movie IDs you want to retrieve (that belongs to the year being retrieved)\n",
    "Check for and remove any previously downloaded movie id's to prevent duplicate API calls.\n",
    "Load in any existing/previous results with pd.read_json\n",
    "Check to see if any of the movie_ids to get are already in the JSON file.\n",
    "Filter out only movies that are missing from JSON file to use in the loop.\n",
    "### Create an INNER loop to make API calls for each id in the YEAR specified in the outer loop. For each id:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load up results thus far from JSON file as a list.\n",
    "Extract current ID from API and extract dictionary of results\n",
    "Append the new results to the list from the JSON file\n",
    "Save the updated JSON file back to disk\n",
    "After the inner loop, save the final results for that year as a csv.gz file with the year in the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the outer loop repeats for the remaining years.\n",
    "## BEFORE THE LOOPS\n",
    "### Designate a folder\n",
