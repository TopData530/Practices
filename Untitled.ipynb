    "\n",
    "Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand how to use the \"open\" function in Python Understand the \"with\" statement in Python. Use the json module to load and save JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a JSON file?\n",
    "JSON files are text-based files that are structured as a dictionary or a list of dictionaries (also called \"records\"). JSON is used to store and transport data between computers or programs. The results of most API calls will be returned in JSON format. JSON stands for \"JavaScript Object Notation.\" It is plain text written in JavaScript Object notation and is considered \"language independent\" meaning code to read and write JSON occurs in most other coding languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python's json module to make it easier to load and save data to and from JSON files in the correct format. If you were to open and read in the contents of a JSON file without using the json module, you will wind up with one large string.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be learning more about how to interpret JSON files when we obtain our first API results, but we are first going to take some time to ensure you know how to read and write files in python using \"with Open\". We will start with a simple text file, and then we will look more specifically at JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that \"JSON\" as a file format is capitalized, but the file extension (.json) and the Python module \"json\" is not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with .json files, we will go through an example of working with a .txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open function in Python We will use the open function to both write files to disk and to read those files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's open function creates a variable that stays connected to the opened file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It needs the filepath of the file as the first argument, and which mode to open the file in. Example Modes include: \"r\" = read text \"w\" = write text \"rb\" = read binary (like images) \"wb\" = write binary (like images) Note: you can create a NEW file using the open command, as long as it is set to write (w) mode. Python will not indicate whether or not the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices: use the with command to temporarily open a file\n",
    "To avoid keeping a file connection open longer than is needed, we will use the with command in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the with command\n",
    "Whenever we want to safely read and write to a file without accidentally corrupting it, we will use the with statement. The with statement works like an if statement or a forloop. All lines of code that are nested inside the with-statement will be executed with whatever temporary file connections or settings we are using. As soon as the block of code nested inside the with-statement is finished, it will automatically close the file connection, avoiding accidental corruption. Going forward, it is ALWAYS suggested that you use the open function combined with the with statement.\n",

    "Opening JSON Files and using the json module\n",
    "To open data from a JSON file in Python, we will use the \"open\" function in Python combined with the json module.\n",
    "\n",
    "import json\n",
    "The json module has 4 basic functions for saving and loading JSON data.\n",
    "The two functions that we will use regularly are designed to work with files:\n",
    "\n",
    "json.load(file): Loads the data from a json file into a variable (dictionary of list of dictionaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "json.dump(data, file): Saves the JSON-compatible data into a file. While we will not be using them regularly, there are also 2 functions for converting between a string and JSON dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "json.loads: Convert an already-loaded string into a dictionary or list of dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "json.dumps: Convert a dictionary or list of dictionaries into a string. Example to save\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how to create a JSON file, we will create a dictionary called \"data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we are using single quotes in our python dictionary below, even though json files require double quotes. The json module is smart enough to automatically convert single quotes to double quotes when saving the data to the .json file.\n",

    "Working with JSON files is required of data scientists and programmers. It is a file format that is designed for communication between computers. This lesson covered some fundamentals of opening files safely in Python using \"with OPEN\". The json module can be combined with \"with OPEN\" to easily work with JSON files in Python. We will learn more about how to interpret the format in a future lesson.\n",
